<p>>Monday morning came and I returned to work. I was about 80% of the way through *Fugue*, most of the work was done, the conclusion was looming enticingly ahead. The ordeal of first-draft writing was almost over. I sat at my desk and, as I always do, glanced through the last few pages I'd written. Depression and disillusion immediately swept over me: _what I had written now looked, in comparaison wifth Fowle's rich *tour de force*, to be thin, half-imagined, dull, trite, predicatble_ ("Useful Books. the Song of the Book", in *'It' came from outer Space*, p 19-20, _ _ mine) <a href="tag-writing.html">@writing</a> <a href="tag-sf.html">@sf</a>
