<p>>For those wanting an automated reinstall/reconfigure:
According to section 6.4.9 of the Debian Reference Manual, the following will save both the list of packages installed and their debconf configuration:
Code:
# dpkg √êget-selections √í*√ì >myselections # or use \*
# debconf-get-selections > debconfsel.txt
and the following will reinstall and reconfigure them:
Code:
# dselect update
# debconf-set-selections < debconfsel.txt
# dpkg √êset-selections <myselections
# apt-get -u dselect-upgrade # or dselect install
