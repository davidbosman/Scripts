The general idea is that we learn by doing; our understanding of the world comes from moving our body around, pushing solid objects against each other. I suppose it's possible that there are modes of cognition that could exist without these things, but I think they'd be so foreign to us as to be incomprehensible. A virtual body and a virtual environment ought to work just as well as physical ones, assuming the simulation is detailed enough.

</p><p>>The AIs enjoy being touched, but that's a deliberate decision on the part of their designers; it's a way to make them appealing to their owners. There are some autistic children who don't like being touched, and that's hard for their parents, because parents like hugging their kids (...) Touch is important to people, so if you want to encourage an emotional bond between humans and AIs, if you want people to want to spend time with them, you should make touch important to AIs too.
