<p>>I did read about the chimpanzees who'd been taught sign language. They were famous for a while, but you don't usually hear about what happened to them after the language studies were over. Some were sent to medical labs for experimental use. The case I was most interested in was a chimpanzee named Lucy; the humans who'd been teaching her couldn't find a chimp sanctuary that would take her, so they decided to send her to Africa, even though she'd lived her entire life among humans and never seen the jungle before. A grad student named Janis Carter went with her to help her adjust to life in the wild. Janis Carter was supposed to stay there just a few weeks, but pretty quickly she realized that that wasn't going to be enough. She spent years teaching Lucy how to live outdoors and forage for food. Ultimately Lucy died because she wasn't able to adapt to the wild, but I was really struck by Janis Carter's commitment; here was someone who didn't even like camping, and she changed her entire life in order to help Lucy. How many people would be willing to do that for someone who isn't a human being?
