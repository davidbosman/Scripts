<p>>Consider a space station where air must be manufactured at great cost: charging  each breather per liter of air may be fair. But wearing the metered gas mask all day and all night is intolerable even if everyone can afford to pay the oar bill. And the TV cameras everywhere to see if you ever take the mask off are outrageaous. It's better to support the air plant with a head tax and chuck the masks.
