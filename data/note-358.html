<p>>A few people with $5,000 managed to cut a big notch out of something beautiful on which hundreds of hard-working, talented individuals had been focusing their energy for months. One of those builders was publicly shamed by Gizmodo and his reputation is now tarnished. Yet somehow this was the best day of these journalists' lives. Somewhere along the line their sense of self-worth and success became perversely dependent on how well they could employ shady tactics to profit from tearing down other people's hard work. We need less people like that in our society.
