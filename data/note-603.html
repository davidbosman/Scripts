>The purest way to convey emotion in a story is to elicit that emotion from your reader. That's one of my very few hard and fast rules of the craft, so I’ll repeat it: The purest way to convey emotion in a story is to elicit that emotion from your reader. Writing down a string of invective to convey anger pales by comparison to crafting a character whose treatment of—or treatment by—another character arouses genuine anger in the reader. What's the worst criticism you can level at a horror film? It wasn't scary. For a film to be a horror film, it needs to elicit the feeling of fear from a viewer. Again, the purest way to convey emotion in a story is to elicit that emotion from your reader. After all, a comedian isn't funny unless he makes the audience laugh.
