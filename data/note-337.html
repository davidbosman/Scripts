<p>>The AIs enjoy being touched, but that's a deliberate decision on the part of their designers; it's a way to make them appealing to their owners. There are some autistic children who don't like being touched, and that's hard for their parents, because parents like hugging their kids (...) Touch is important to people, so if you want to encourage an emotional bond between humans and AIs, if you want people to want to spend time with them, you should make touch important to AIs too.
