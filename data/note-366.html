>Jelly fish: story without structures ->inert, doesn't take you anywhere.
>Structure is a number of things: skeleton of story. Mussle/heart/logic/voice/... Purpose/direction/It's life. It insures the story starts at an interesting points for the reader. Engages us with the characters, in situations where reader can feel empathy fo them. It is plot and more.
>Plot cames from conflict. Conflict must seems truly in the nature of the characters. 
> More than just a serie of events.
> Character's motivations -> one of the most important things.
> You have to know what he/she want/need. Why does (s)he?
> How bad does he wants it?
> they ahve a nature: who are they?
> Discovering the plot depends on discovering the characters.
> they have to make choices. 
> **Finding story structures** 1/ outline in detail before start write writing (better for novel) 2/ discover it has you go. Getting it on a the page, scary. Outline after first draft to see global, see fail. trust your characters; listen to them.
> I don't do biography of my characters.
> Writing is revising.
> Rewriting. straight structural problems. very few of us get it right
