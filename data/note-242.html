<p>>Only a week  or two ago xas I reading a sriously written, article by Isaac Asimov, in which he earnestly explained why characterisation was not and *should not be* the concerne of science fiction writers. How can any writer, howerver propped up by visions of achieved worldly success, believe such nonsens for even a moment ? <br />And I find the same sense of irrelevance in what little science fioction I read these days. I seems to me that most contemporary science foiction is an end rpoduct: it has become a derived, secondary form, drawing on itself and the most banal influences, rendering itself into the literary equivalent of bio-degradable plastic bottles.<br /> Thebest fiction is that wich dares to chance, wich cares nothing for genre or form or accepted wisdom.<br />Chance is a fine thing, but many contemporary science fiction writers have let chance be beaten up out of them by the bully-boys of conformism.
