<p>>The difference between the image our left eye sees versus what our right eye sees— the contrast— is what creates our perception of depth. I'm using a literal example of depth with respect to writing because the metaphor pans out very well. Depth is the result of the intersection of contrasting elements. Not necessarily total opposites, just different... different enough.
