<p>>Debbie Reynolds, who was 18 at the time and had her first major role in "Singin' in the Rain," had never sung or danced before, but she said years later: "I learned a lot from Gene. He is a perfectionist and a disciplinarian: the most exacting director I've worked for. And he has a good temper. Every so often he would yell at me and make me cry. But it took a lot of patience for him to work with someone who had never danced before."
