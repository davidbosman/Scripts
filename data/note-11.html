<p>>Hitchings also feels that clear-cut distinctions between slow and fast reading are slightly idealistic. "In short, the fast-slow polarity--or antithesis, if you prefer--strikes me as false. We all have several guises as readers. If I am reading--to pick an obvious example--James Joyce, slow reading feels appropriate. If I'm reading the instruction manual for a new washing machine, it doesn't."
