# This script is the second of two that will import a bunch of text files 
# formated in Markdown as Day One entries.
#
# In order to work, it requires Day One's CLI:
# http://dayoneapp.com/tools/
#
# It takes txt files in entry, with the name formated as:
# dont le nom commence par AAAA-MMJJ. 
#
# For each file, it'll create a new entry ion Day One, using the file name
# to set the date. 
# It'll use the time in the title to det the time.
