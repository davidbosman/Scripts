# This script is the first of two that will import a bunch of text files 
# formated in Markdown as Day One entries.
# In order to work, each file name must start with AAAA-MMDD (wich will be as 
# the date of the entries) and contain only one entry. So if, like me, you 
# used to write a day worth of entries in a single file, like this:
#
# 2012-0816-J-my daily diary.txt:
#
# ### 17H32
# Some text. 
#
# ### 23h41
# Some more text.
#
# ![alt text](link to an image)
#
# Some more text.
#
# ### some title but no time stamp
# Some text, again.
#
# this script will look for occurences of ## or ### (or none, at the first 
# line of the file) and, for each one consisting of a time stamp, will create 
# a new file. (other ### will be added to the previous time stamp). 
# So the example will look like this after spliting:
#
# 2012-0816-J-my daily diary1.txt:
#
# ### 17H32
# Some text. 
#
# 2012-0816-J-my daily diary2.txt:
#
# ### 23h41
# Some more text.
#
# ![alt text](link to an image)
#
# Some more text.
#
# ### some title but not a time stamp
# Some text, again.
#
# Each new file will be created in a temporay export folder 
# ("~/Desktop/output"). This folder *must* exist before running the script.
# 
# The second script, Import2DayOne.sh, will deal with the import process 
# itself, using Day One CLI.

		# CHANGE PATH if you want to.
